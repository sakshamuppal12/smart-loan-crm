## **🚀 LIVE DEMO:** [Click here to see the project in action!](https://smart-loan-crm-9c860c8ee5b7.herokuapp.com/)

⚡ **Note:** This project is a **live prototype** built for **training, demonstration, and recruiter showcase purposes**.

- Debugging information and internal workflows are **intentionally visible** for learners and reviewers.
- Not a production deployment — instead, a **working educational system** demonstrating **real AI + CRM integration**.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

> **Objective:** Provide loan officers with a **data-driven, AI-assisted tool** that evaluates loans, flags high-risk cases, tracks activity, and visualizes live performance data.

This platform delivers:

- Instant **loan default risk prediction** (Likely to Default = Flagged Loan)
- **AI Loan Assistant** for officer queries and insights
- **CRM dashboards** with live charts
- **Flagged Loan filters + downloadable reports**
- **History module** for tracking all past evaluations

---

## 🗂️ Core Modules

1. **Prediction**
   - Officers input loan & borrower details
   - ML model predicts default probability
   - AI Assistant explains “why default / why not”

2. **CRM**
   - Live **Pie Chart + Bar Chart** showing system-wide prediction stats
   - Charts update in **real time** with actual prediction data

3. **Flagged Loans**
   - Displays **loans likely to default**
   - Filter by **today, this week, overall**
   - Export results as **downloadable report**

4. **History**
   - Complete log of all past predictions
   - Filter by timeframe
   - Export as **downloadable file**

## 🤖 AI Loan Assistant

The integrated **AI Loan Assistant** enhances officer workflows:

- Answers operational questions like:
  - _“Who am I?”_
  - _“What loans did I approve today?”_
  - _“Why did this loan default?”_
  - _“Show me total predictions this week.”_
  - _“List my last predictions.”_
  - _"And many more"_
- Current version: **rule-based + dataset-powered Q&A**
- Roadmap: Expanding to **NLP-driven assistant** with natural conversation capability

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML + TailwindCSS
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, free tier)
- **ML / AI:** Scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier), joblib
- **AI Assistant:** Rule-based Q&A → (planned NLP integration)
- **Security:** Flask-Login, bcrypt; Role-based authentication (Admin/User)
- **Deployment:** Heroku (App) + Supabase (DB)
